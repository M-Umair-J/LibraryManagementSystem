Simple Library Management System with File Hadling Feature (Without GUI)
The System consists of four classes i.e, Book, Library, User, Main
The Library class consists of all the functions that are performed on the data in the Book class and the User class
The Library class consists of file handling functions for storing and retrieving data from the files
An important thing is that the files location that stores the user and the book data is set to be C:\\ drive you can find the files created there
You can also change the location based on your own choice
The most important thing is that when the user enters the book or the user id, that number is used as a seed value to generate the random id that will be assigned to that particular book or the user
So to know what the actual IDs are you need to use the option of displaying all the book IDs available and then use the information to retrieve or return the books to the required users
